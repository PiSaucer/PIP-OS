# PIP-OS For TI-84 Plus CE only

To install you need:
- TI-84 Plus CE
- A Computer with the downloaded files
- TI Connect CE

First install TI Connect CE your computer. Then connect your TI-84. Drag and drop the files on to you calculators memory. Go to your programs and select PIPLOAD. This will have a nice loading screen that I am still working on that will load PIPOS. If you just want PIPOS you can just run that. But you need PIPOS install for the loader to run. This is still way out of release. Please bare with me.
