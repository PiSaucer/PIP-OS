# Privacy Policy for PIP Boy on the Google Assistant

The content for PIP Boy has been developed by PiSaucer. However, PIP Boy runs on systems provided by Google, and PiSaucer does not have full access to the app. In particular, PiSaucer has no ability to access the messages you send to PIP Boy or the responses that it sends back to you.

PiSaucer may receive from Google non-personally identifying information about the use of PIP Boy. For instance, PiSaucer can access usage information regarding how many users are using the app, which geographical regions they are located in, and basic data including users’ language, device type, and length and frequency of use. None of the information PiSaucer receives from Google identifies you, nor does it reveal to PiSaucer what information you sent to the app or what specific responses the app sent to you.

When you use PIP Boy, you are also using the Google Assistant, and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) describes how Google collects and uses data about your use of the app. You may wish to consult Google’s documentation [regarding what information is shared with your Google Assistant](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7126196) and [how to delete your Google Assistant activity.](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7108295)

PiSaucer may, in the future, modify PIP Boy to run on infrastructure which PiSaucer has full access to, which would allow PiSaucer access to additional information about your interaction with the app. Should that occur, PiSaucer will comply with its obligations under applicable privacy law, including updating this Privacy Policy as required.
